## Turning Data into Action. An R Package for the Wildfire Resilience Index
#### Abstract

Wildfires pose escalating risks to communities and ecosystems across the western U.S., requiring integrated resilience strategies that account for both social and environmental dimensions. The Wildfire Resilience Index (WRI) quantifies resilience across eight domains; Infrastructure, Communities, Livelihoods, Sense of Place, Species, Habitats, Water, and Air, providing a spatially explicit framework for identifying vulnerabilities and strengths. Despite its utility, the WRI's underlying data consist of over 100 high-resolution geospatial layers totaling several terabytes, creating a substantial barrier for researchers and practitioners who lack the computational resources to download and analyze these datasets locally. This project addresses this accessibility gap by developing an open-source R package that allows users to query cloud-hosted WRI data without managing large files. The package will provide functions to retrieve WRI scores and domain-level data, generate basic visualizations, and access statistical summaries. By making WRI data easier to access, this tool will help more researchers use wildfire resilience metrics in their work, supporting better wildfire preparedness, response, and recovery across the western U.S. and Canada.
